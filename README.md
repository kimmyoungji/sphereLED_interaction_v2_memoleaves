# COSS LED Sphere Display interactive Contents: memoleaves - memory lives in graden
This project is a web-based interactive system that connects with the LED Sphere Display 
installed in the CO-SHOW(Conference on Convergence and Open Sharing Systems)

The main subjects of this project are dementia and plants.
Our team was inspired by the visual similarity between plant stems and brain cells, 
and we express the personal experiences of an elderly man named James, who suffers from dementia, 
through the imagery of plants.
